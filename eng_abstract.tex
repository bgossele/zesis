Advances in bioinformatics have driven down the cost of genome sequencing dramatically over the past years. This raises the question how to efficiently and flexibly handle and store the large amount of data this process generates. Similar developments in web technology have spawned numerous NoSQL and NewSQL datastores in the last decade, which offer robust, highly scalable distributed storage and flexible data modelling. \\
This master's thesis reviews 6 such datastores and their possible applications to bioinformatics. We also propose a design and implementation of a scalable genome analysis tool aimed at flexible analysis of genetic variation in large populations with an enriched SQL-syntax. Our design is based on GEMINI, replacing the original underlying SQLite-database with Apache Cassandra.\\
Leveraging a new datamodel and custom client-side querymechanism, our implementation achieves up to 150x faster querying than the original version of GEMINI, at the cost of duplication and slower initial loading of data.
